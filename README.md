# robot-arm-control-panel
This project allows you to control a robot arm via a web-based control panel. The control panel is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and communicates with an ESP-based microcontroller to move the robot arm's joints. The system utilizes a simple web interface to send commands to the microcontroller over Wi-Fi, enabling real-time control.
